# caustic_stack

Description:
Takes kinematic data of galaxies and overlays their individual phase spaces--clustercentric-radius
and line-of-sight velocity--on top of each other ("stacking"), to create an ensemble phase space or
ensemble cluster. It then runs the caustic technique on the ensemble cluster's phase space. At 
the most basic level, this code needs only RA and Dec of galaxies on the sky, or their X, Y, Z position
in a cube.
