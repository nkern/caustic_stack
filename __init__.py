caustic_stack

Description:
------------
Takes kinematic data of galaxies and overlays their individual phase spaces--clustercentric-radius
and line-of-sight velocity--on top of each other ("stacking"), to create an ensemble phase space or
ensemble cluster. It then runs the *caustic technique* on the ensemble cluster's phase space. At 
the most basic level, this code needs only RA and Dec of galaxies on the sky, or their X, Y, Z position
in a cube.
